He expects students to have a strong understanding of the material and does not always thoroughly explain concepts. His handwriting is difficult to read, and he tends to solve problems on the board without giving students a chance to think through them first. However, he offers extra credit and reviews before exams, and if you put in the effort, it is possible to pass the class. Some students find his lectures helpful and appreciate his unconventional teaching methods, while others struggle to understand him and feel that he is not a fair grader. Overall, it seems that taking his class requires dedication and self-study.", "sentiment": "0.8"}}
